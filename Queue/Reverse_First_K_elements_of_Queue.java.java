/* Question - Given an integer K and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.

Only following standard operations are allowed on queue.

enqueue(x) : Add an item x to rear of queue
dequeue() : Remove an item from front of queue
size() : Returns number of elements in queue.
front() : Finds front item.
Note: The above operations represent the general processings. In-built functions of the respective languages can be used to solve the problem. */
